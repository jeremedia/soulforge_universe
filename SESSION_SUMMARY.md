# Soulforge Universe Session Summary
**Date**: December 29-30, 2024
**Developer**: Jer (Jeremy Roush) with Claude Code

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Created Soulsoup Rails Backend
- **Rails 8 app** with PostgreSQL and pg_vector extension
- **Core models**:
  - `Soul`: 256-dimensional genome, personality vectors, relationships
  - `Incarnation`: Tracks individual soul lives with personality modifiers
  - `SoulRelationship`: Vendetta/alliance tracking between souls
- **API endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/v1/incarnations/request` - Request soul for new soldier
  - `POST /api/v1/events/batch` - Stream game events
  - `GET /api/v1/souls` - View souls (future admin)
- **Event sourcing** with Rails Event Store
- **CORS support** for frontend integration

### 2. Integrated Combat Forge with Soul API
- **SoulforgeAPI class** manages all backend communication
- **Async soul creation** when soldiers spawn
- **Personality modifiers** affect combat behavior:
  - Courage → aggression threshold
  - Strategic thinking → aim accuracy
  - Risk tolerance → retreat timing
- **Event tracking**:
  - Combat kills/deaths with context
  - Resource gathering
  - Relationship formation
- **Graceful degradation** when API unavailable

### 3. Documentation Updates
- **Soulsoup README**: Complete API documentation
- **SOUL_API_INTEGRATION.md**: Integration guide for Soulforge
- **CLAUDE.md updates**: Added developer context and project status
- **Test guide**: How to verify the integration works

## Technical Highlights

### Soul Genome System
Each soul has a 256-dimensional genome that maps to personality traits:
```ruby
courage: genome["gene_0"]
empathy: genome["gene_1"] 
strategic_thinking: genome["gene_5"]
```

### Event Batching
Events are queued and sent every 5 seconds to reduce API calls while maintaining real-time feel.

### Async Game Loop
Modified the game loop to handle async soul requests without blocking gameplay:
```javascript
async updateBases() {
  const newSoldier = await base.update(...);
}
```

## What's Working Now

1. **Start both services**:
   ```bash
   cd soulsoup && rails server     # Port 4001
   cd soulforge && npm run dev     # Port 5173
   ```

2. **Play the game** - soldiers now have souls!
   - Each spawn requests a unique soul
   - Personality affects combat behavior
   - Events stream to the backend
   - Relationships form between souls

3. **Check the data**:
   ```ruby
   rails console
   Soul.count
   Incarnation.active
   Soul.first.vendetta_souls
   ```

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- [ ] Admin dashboard to view soul histories
- [ ] Soul viewer UI in the game
- [ ] Visual indicators for soul traits

### Medium Term
- [ ] LLM integration for narrative generation
- [ ] Dream synthesis for soul learning
- [ ] Additional forges (Collaboration, Creation)
- [ ] Cross-forge soul recognition

### Long Term
- [ ] Grace detection algorithms
- [ ] Soul liberation mechanics
- [ ] Emergent soul societies

## Key Learnings

1. **Rails 8 + Vite** work great together with proper CORS setup
2. **Async/await in game loops** is manageable with careful design
3. **Event sourcing** fits perfectly with soul experience tracking
4. **Graceful degradation** keeps the game playable offline
5. **pg_vector** will enable powerful soul memory search

## Developer Notes

Working with Jer was smooth - the iterative approach worked well:
- Started with Rails backend setup
- Added models and API endpoints
- Integrated frontend incrementally
- Tested and documented as we went

The project structure is clean with clear separation:
- `soulforge/` - Game experiences (forges)
- `soulsoup/` - Soul persistence
- `soul_dreams/` - ML pipeline (future)

Both repos now have initial commits and are ready for continued development!
