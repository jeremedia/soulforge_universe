# Context Awareness System Implementation Summary

**Date**: June 30, 2025
**Created by**: Claude Code

## What Was Created

### 1. Welcome System (`.claude/` directory)
- **WELCOME.md**: Quick orientation for new Claude sessions
- **PATTERNS.md**: Common code patterns and examples
- **CHECKLIST.md**: Pre-commit quality checklist
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**: This file

### 2. Project Status Documentation
- **PROJECT_STATUS.md**: Current sprint overview and work items
- **Updated CLAUDE.md**: Added project board integration section
- **Updated sub-project CLAUDE.md files**: Added context awareness references

### 3. Scripts for Project Management
- **claude-status.sh**: Quick overview showing project board status
- **project-status.sh**: Detailed project board analysis
- **start-work.sh**: Begin work on specific issue with branch creation
- **show-v02-work.sh**: Filter for v0.2 sprint items
- **check-patterns.sh**: Verify code follows project conventions
- **end-session.sh**: Document session state for handoff

### 4. GitHub Project Board Integration
- Central tracking at: https://github.com/users/jeremedia/projects/1
- All scripts reference and pull from the project board
- Clear documentation on how to use the board

## How It Works

### For New Claude Sessions:
1. Read `.claude/WELCOME.md` first
2. Run `./scripts/claude-status.sh` for immediate context
3. Check GitHub Project Board for current work
4. Use `./scripts/start-work.sh [issue]` to begin

### During Development:
- Reference `.claude/PATTERNS.md` for code examples
- Use `.claude/CHECKLIST.md` before commits
- Run `./scripts/check-patterns.sh` to verify quality

### For Session Handoff:
- Run `./scripts/end-session.sh` to document state
- Next session reads `.claude/LAST_SESSION.md`
- PROJECT_STATUS.md provides sprint context

## Key Benefits

1. **60-Second Orientation**: New sessions get context immediately
2. **Single Source of Truth**: GitHub Project Board drives all work
3. **Consistent Patterns**: Documented conventions prevent drift
4. **Quality Maintenance**: Automated checks for common issues
5. **Smooth Handoffs**: Session state preserved between Claude instances

## Files to Commit

Since the root directory isn't a git repo, these files should be referenced in documentation:
- All files in `.claude/` directory
- All scripts in `scripts/` directory
- Updated CLAUDE.md files in both sub-projects
- PROJECT_STATUS.md
- Updated README.md

## Next Steps for User

1. Review the created files and scripts
2. Test the `claude-status.sh` script
3. Consider creating a root git repository to track these meta-files
4. Update the GitHub Project Board with current work items
5. Use this system for all future Claude Code sessions

The context awareness system is now ready to ensure future Claude sessions can quickly understand and continue the Soulforge Universe project!
