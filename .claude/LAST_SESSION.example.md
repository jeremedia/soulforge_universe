## Current Work
Issue #1 in soulsoup - Implement basic soul learning from combat experience

## Repository State
- **soulforge_battle**: branch `master` (0 uncommitted files)
- **soulsoup**: branch `feature/issue-1` (3 uncommitted files)

## Recent Activity
```

```

## What Was Accomplished
1. âœ… Created soul_experiences table migration
2. âœ… Added experience accumulation to CombatEvent processing  
3. âœ… Implemented basic personality drift algorithm
4. ðŸš§ Started on soul learning API endpoint (50% complete)

## Current State Details
- Working on `app/controllers/api/v1/souls_controller.rb`
- Need to finish the learning endpoint that applies experience
- Tests are written but not passing yet (missing endpoint implementation)

## Blockers/Issues
- Personality drift calculation needs refinement - currently too aggressive
- Need to decide on experience decay rate (see TODO in soul.rb:147)

## Next Steps
1. Finish the learning API endpoint
2. Fix the failing tests in `test/controllers/api/v1/souls_controller_test.rb`
3. Test integration with soulforge frontend
4. Consider adding experience visualization to combat UI

## Key Decisions Made
- Using logarithmic scale for experience impact (diminishing returns)
- Personality vectors drift maximum 0.1 per incarnation
- Experience older than 30 days has reduced weight

## Session Notes
The personality drift algorithm is working but might be too dramatic. Current formula:
```ruby
drift = (experience_weight * 0.1 * (rand - 0.5))
```

Consider reducing the 0.1 multiplier or adding personality "inertia" to prevent
souls from changing too quickly. Discussed idea of "personality anchors" - certain
traits that are harder to change based on the soul's genome.

Also noticed that vendetta relationships could influence personality drift - souls
might become more aggressive after repeated deaths to the same enemy. Worth exploring
in the relationship system work.

## Related Issues
- #3 (Create vendetta relationship system) - will need experience data
- #29 (Display soul personality evolution) - blocked until API complete

## Performance Note
The experience aggregation query is getting slow with test data. May need to add
indexes on soul_experiences (soul_id, created_at) if we're doing time-based queries.

---

**Handoff Summary**: Continue with the soul learning API endpoint. The hard part 
(experience accumulation) is done. Just need to wire up the endpoint and fix tests.
